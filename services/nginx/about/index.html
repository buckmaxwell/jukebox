        <p>When I started developing earbud.club, I intended it to be a way of sharing my Spotify acccount with
          my own friends, without the commotion that went along with passing my phone around at a party.</p>

        <p>Passing a phone means lockouts, friends asking for your password, and the chance that your *very* lovely
          friend,
          who happens to have an affinity for Christian Chill Wave Remixes of Soul Classics, babysits the music all
          night. Not to mention that lingering fear that your personal trove of embarrasing nude selfies will be found
          at any moment.</p>

        <p>And earbud.club is all that. But then Covid-19 happened, and I needed a way to make my music parties remote.
          So now, you can share music with friends while you're together, and while you're keeping your distance. I
          hope
          you have fun.
        </p>

      <div class="sexn troubleshooting">
        <p>Sorry to hear things aren't going as expected. Here are some things that might be going wrong. If you keep
          having issues please send me an <a href="mailto:maxwellhigginsbuck@gmail.com">email</a> or leave me an issue
          on github.</p>

        <h2>Songs aren't playing</h2>

        <p>If songs aren't playing, it's probably because you don't have any active devices on Spotify. Start the party
          by playing a song on your Spotify account.</p>

        <h2>Adding rooms</h2>

        To add a room, you'll need a Spotify premium account. Click on 'Host Or Cohost' in the navbar, authenticate with
        Spotify, then click 'Add a Room'. You should see your room get added to the table.

        <p> <strong>If your friends are in the same physical room as you</strong>, share the code with them and have
          them enter
          it on the main page of the site. To add songs to your own room you can do the same - click on 'Queue Songs' to
          get back to the main page.</p>

        <h2>Sharing your room, or following someone else's</h2>

        <p> <strong>If your friends are in a different physical space</strong>, share the code with them and have them
          'Follow'
          your room. They'll have to click on 'Host or Cohost', authenticate with their premium account, and then click
          the 'Follow Room' button to connect their account. Once their account is connected, have them go back to the
          main site by clicking 'Queue Songs' and enter the same 4 character code. When they queue a song, it will queue
          on both of your devices.</p>
        <p>*Make sure your friend knows that they should start playing a song on Spotify first*, or else earbud.club
          won't know
          which device to play on... and it won't play at all :( </p>

      <div class="sexn faq">
        <h3>Is it free?</h3>
        Yes, but if you want to host or co-host you need a Spotify premium subscription.
        <h3>Doesn't Spotify already have this functionality?</h3>
        No, Spotify does have a beta version of a tool for sharing your queue in a group, but it requires everyone to
        have Spotify. Spotify has no way of sharing a queue accross multiple devices at the same time.
        <h3>How do most people use earbud.club?</h3>
        <p>Creating a democratic jukebox at parties, sharing the car stereo, and enjoying music with people who are far
          away are all uses we love. If you want to tell me the story of how you are using earbud.club, please send me
          an email! </p>
        <h3>Is it open source?</h3>
        Yes. The project lives on <a href="https://github.com/buckmaxwell/jukebox">github</a>. Feel free to give it a
        look and if you feel like submitting a PR to improve it, please do.
